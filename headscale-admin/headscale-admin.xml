  <Overview>Headscale-Admin is meant to be a simple, modern web interface for juanfont/headscale - "An open source, self-hosted implementation of the Tailscale control server."&#xD;
&#xD;
Headscale-Admin should currently be considered a beta application. It is very much still in active development and should not be treated as a final product, but when used properly, it should be safe to run in a production environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
You need to host both headscale and Headscale-Admin on the same DNS record. For NPM use Custom locations and use /admin/ as location and forward IP and port from this docker.&#xD;
&#xD;
Go into headscale console and issue a "headscale apikeys create" command to get your API key.</Overview>
